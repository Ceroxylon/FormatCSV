# FormatCSV
A simple CSV formatting framework using Python pandas

This is built for a specific network export/import setup, add your own pathways and formatting twists by adjusting the template to make that round file fit into that square hole.

In practice this takes a file from an export folder and formats it for use in a separate database as part of a larger automated process.

Pandas makes formatting very easy! Fork this code and use it to make your tedious tasks melt into the background.
